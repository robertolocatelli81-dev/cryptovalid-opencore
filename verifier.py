Independently verifies a hash-chained ledger (*.jsonl) with NOTHING but the
Python standard library (hashlib, json, sys, argparse).

Verified schema:
  - each line is JSON with at least: {idx, ts, data, prev_hash, self_hash}
  - self_hash = SHA-256( JSON(entry without self_hash, sort_keys, separators (',',':')) )
  - prev_hash of entry i = self_hash of entry i-1 (the first has 64 zeros)

Output: structured JSON receipt with an explicit `scope` (what PASS proves and does not prove).
Exit code 0 = chain intact, 1 = failure (a file with zero entries is a failure: nothing was verified), 74 = the receipt
could not be written whole (stdout or the --out file: full, closed, a reader gone), whatever the verdict.

Example:
    python3 opencore/verifier.py exports/omega_audit_ledger.jsonl
    python3 opencore/verifier.py ledger.jsonl --algo sha3_256

Reproducible by any third-party auditor: same file, same schema -> same receipt.
